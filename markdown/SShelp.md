### Search

Enter any keyword or combination of keywords and the Coro2vid-19 search engine will return the most similar articles to those terms.

### Query style

Options to change the search behavior. There are three options to choose from:

- **Compound** (default): adds up if more than one keyword is entered and takes into account the total sum of the similarity scores for each word
- **AND:** similar to compound but keyword similarities are not added but multiplied, which is then used to find similar articles
- **OR:** returns the most similar articles related to all entered keywords independently
